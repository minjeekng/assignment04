# First ggplot2 Graph (Bar Chart)

## Breif Dataset Explanation:

The data used in Graph 1 is a 2015 - 2023 dataset that reflects fertility rates for provinces on a website run by South Korean government called the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS).

```{r}
# First ggplot2 Graph (Bar Chart)
# **Need to add a proper subtitle
# **Need to design it later (font size color etc)

# We used abbreviation of provinces' names, instead of full name. The reason is 
#that the province's names are long.

```
## Dataset Graph Output Explanation:

Even in South Korean society, where the low birth rate is severe, the gap in fertility rates between regions is widening and the reason for this gap is mainly due to the infrastructure gap. Sejong, the highest birth region found in the graph, was constructed in 2012 when the central government of Korea moved here. This city may have the highest birth rate because of its infrastructure and gathering of people with stable employment. The birth rate is affected by various factors, such as jobs, housing, and education, and it is in Sejong that the three major factors work well. However, although the capital city of Seoul has many jobs, it actually has the highest housing prices, so the low birth rate exists.

## Dataset Graph Output Explanation:
The chart shows a generally upward trend in private education expenditures in Seoul from 2016 to 2023. Despite some fluctuations in year 2020 which may be influenced by the outbreak of COVID-19, the overall increase suggests growing demand or greater investment in private education over this period. By 2023, expenditures are noticeably higher than in 2016, indicating that private education remains a significant and possibly expanding sector. However, additional context—such as population changes, policy shifts, or economic factors—would be needed to fully explain the observed trend.
